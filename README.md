# GoSIEr

_This project is in a very early stage._

GoSIEr is a project for implementing the SIE financial data format in
Go, both in an accurate and pragmatic sense. It also provides an
alternative protocol buffer representation of the SIE format (tbd).

The name is a portmanteau of Go and SIE with an r added to the end
because that happens to be a rather nice town on Guadelope.
